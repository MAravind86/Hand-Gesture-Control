# Hand Gesture Control System - Controls Guide

## 🎮 Hand Gestures

### Primary Controls
- **Left Hand**: Control screen brightness using thumb and index finger
- **Right Hand**: Control system volume using thumb and index finger
- **Distance Control**: Adjust the distance between thumb and index finger to change values

### Gesture-Based Freeze Controls
- **🤜 Closed Fist**: Freeze the control (brightness or volume)
- **🖐️ Four Fingers**: Release the freeze and resume control (index, middle, ring, pinky extended, thumb closed)
- **👍 Thumbs Up**: Reset both controls to 0%

### How Gesture Freeze Works
- **Left Hand Closed Fist**: Freezes brightness at current level
- **Right Hand Closed Fist**: Freezes volume at current level
- **Left Hand Four Fingers**: Releases brightness freeze
- **Right Hand Four Fingers**: Releases volume freeze
- **Either Hand Thumbs Up**: Resets both controls to 0%

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

### Freeze Controls
- **F**: Toggle freeze/unfreeze for both brightness and volume
- **B**: Toggle freeze/unfreeze for brightness only
- **V**: Toggle freeze/unfreeze for volume only
- **R**: Reset both controls to 0%

### How Freeze Works
- When frozen, the control maintains its current value
- Hand gestures are ignored while frozen
- Perfect for maintaining a specific brightness/volume level
- Unfreeze to resume hand control
- **Gesture Priority**: Gesture controls work alongside keyboard shortcuts

## 💡 Tips for Best Experience

### Hand Positioning
- Keep your hands clearly visible to the camera
- Ensure good lighting for better detection
- Maintain consistent distance from camera
- Use smooth, deliberate movements

### Gesture Tips
- **Closed Fist**: Make sure all fingers are curled (not just thumb and index)
- **Four Fingers**: Extend index, middle, ring, and pinky fingers while keeping thumb closed
- **Thumbs Up**: Keep thumb extended while other fingers are closed
- **Hold Gestures**: Keep the gesture for 1-2 seconds for reliable detection

### Freeze Usage
- Freeze when you want to maintain current settings
- Useful during presentations or when you need stable levels
- Unfreeze when you want to adjust again

### Troubleshooting
